# glycoTS

This repository houses Python (Jupyter notebooks) and R codes used in the analysis of glycogene expressions in single-cell data of Tabula Sapiens. 

The work is described in the following manuscript:
P. Chrysinas, S. Venkatesan, I. Ang, V. Ghosh, C. Chen, S. Neelamegham, and Rudiyanto Gunawan. Cell and tissue-specific glycosylation pathways informed by single-cell transcriptomics, _bioRxiv_ 559616, 2023

Two webtools, glycoCARTA and glycoTF, are available for exploring glycogene and glycopathway expression and transcriptional regulation. These webtools are parts of Systems Glycobiology resource [virtualglycome.org](https://www.virtualglycome.org). We provide an example use case of glycoCARTA and glycoTF here: [Tutorial](https://cabsel.github.io/glycoTS/).
